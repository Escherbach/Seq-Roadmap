 <p><span class="marginnote"><img src="images/image1.png" alt="Image of a Rhinoceros"/>F.J. Cole, “The History of Albrecht Dürer’s Rhinoceros in Zooological Literature,” <em>Science, Medicine, and History: Essays on the Evolution of Scientific Thought and Medical Practice</em> (London, 1953), ed. E. Ashworth Underwood, 337-356. From page 71 of Edward Tufte’s <em>Visual Explanations</em>.</span> But tight integration of graphics with text is central to Tufte’s work even when those graphics are ancillary to the main body of a text. In many of those cases, a margin figure may be most appropriate. To place figures in the margin, just wrap an image (or whatever) in a margin note inside a <code>p</code> tag, as seen to the right of this paragraph.</p>
