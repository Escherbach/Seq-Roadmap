Imagine a world in which every clinician and patient around the world had access to a simple device capable of detecting any virus or bacterium causing disease in a symptomatic patient. Such a world would be much better positioned to diagnose and treat infectious disease and to detect novel emerging pathogens before they cause a devastating pandemic. [Metagenomic sequencing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0113-7) (MGS) has the potential to become such a universal diagnostic. However, it is not yet ready for prime time: complex workflows and high costs prevent widespread adoption.

In this report, we ask how MGS could become widely available, at least as much as diagnostic PCR machines are today. The answer we arrive at is that a device capable of performing 10 million RNA reads in less than an hour with minimal library preparation would be well positioned to deliver on this goal. We then review the current technological landscape and conclude that adaptation of least two mature approaches, single-molecule optical and nanopore sequencing, could meet these specifications if optimized for human respiratory samples.

## Motivation
The first COVID-19 infection occured in mid-October to mid-November of 2019, [at least six weeks earlier than the Wuhan cluster of infections was identified in late December 2019](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf8003). The SARS-CoV-2 genome was only made publicly available in January 2020, more than two months after the first human transmission. This delay resulted in millions of deaths and trillions of dollars in economic costs.

COVID-19 - far from the worst pandemic we could face within our lifetimes - has clearly demonstrated that our ability to detect and contain new pathogens is inadequate. The diagnostic technologies we use for infections at the point of care are designed for a small set of known pathogens and in principle incapable of recognizing the outbreak of an unsuspected or unknown pathogen.

There is therefore a [pressing need](https://councilonstrategicrisks.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Toward-A-Global-Pathogen-Early-Warning-System_2021_07_20-1.pdf) for a near-universal diagnostic to enable rapid detection of all pathogens and their early containment. While it is impossible to predict in advance the nature of a novel threat, we can be confident that its genetic information will be encoded in DNA and RNA. There is therefore a clear candidate technology, the one that [identified SARS-CoV-2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2001017) where others failed: metagenomic sequencing (MGS). 

MGS, also known as unbiased sequencing, is based on the simple idea of analyzing all DNA or RNA in a sample in a hypothesis-free manner. MGS can be leveraged for early detection in a number of ways, including sequencing sites searching for emerging pathogens in airport or municipal wastewater, or strategic testing of "sentinel" populations. In this roadmap, however, we focus solely on the vision of MGS deployed widely at the point of care for detection of pathogens in human respiratory samples. The point-of-care approach has  a number of advantages, including economic self-sustainability and scalability and the ability to identify infected individuals.
