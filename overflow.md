As discussed in Understanding the Target, we can expect to have \~6ng/mL of total RNA. The majority of the above sequencing platforms can not directly sequence this sample type. Either they are unable to sequence RNA directly (Illumina, MGI, PacBio, Ion Torrent) or sample input requirements are too high (ONT). Surprisingly, the only platform capable of directly sequencing such samples is provided by SeqLL, likely the smallest player in the next-gen sequencing market. This company provides a platform previously developed by defunct sequencing startup Helicos.
