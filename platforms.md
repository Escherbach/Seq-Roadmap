# Sequencing Platforms
In this section, we evaluate the current landscape of sequencing platforms against the technical requirements we have previously established:

1. Platforms should process single samples (Background).
2. Time to answer should be less than 1 hour (Background).
3. The COGS should be comparable to qPCR (<$5).
4. Single base accuracy should be higher than 95% (Appendix A).
5. Throughput should be sufficient to provide near equivalent sensitivity to qPCR (based on the analysis shown in “Sensitivity”, this should be on the order of 10M reads.
6. Reads should be at least 18bp (Understanding the target, and Appendix A).
