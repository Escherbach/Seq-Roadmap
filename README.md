# A roadmap towards ubiquitous metagenomic sequencing

COVID-19 has clearly demonstrated that our ability to detect and contain new pathogens capable of causing a pandemic are not up to the task. This is all the more worrying since we can be confident that SARS-CoV-2 is far from the worst pathogen we could face within our lifetimes. There is therefore a pressing need for technological solutions to enable fast detection of new pathogens and their early containment with rapidly available mass testing.

Metagenomic sequencing (MGS) was previously identified as a technology that could accomplish this goal. However, in COVID-19, we have seen that sequencing has had a limited relative to its huge potential: while it has aided initial sequence identification and variant tracking, a number of bottlenecks prevent its widespread adoption at the point of need.

In this report, we look at these bottlenecks and attempt a first-principles analysis of what it would take to make technology for metagenomic sequencing truly ubiquitous, fit for developed and low-income countries alike. Given the urgency of the issue, we look for solutions involving low technical risk and are can substantially enable our preparedness for potential new pandemics in a 5-year timeframe.

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pandemic preparedness** | World vulnerable to novel pathogens; majority of infectious disease undiagnosed. | Routine pathogen-agnostic testing for severe respirarory disease. | Metagenomic sequencing widespread in the clinic and point of need. |
| **Sequencing technology** | ~30,000 sequencers, mostly in centralized laboratories.      | Millions of devices at the point of need.                    | Integrated low-cost sample-to-answer devices.                |
| **Sample preparation**    | Complex workflows, lack of standardization, contamination issues. | Low-cost automated qPCR-style sample preparation             | Standardized injection-molded reagent cartridges.            |
| **Sequencing platforms**  | - Cost of goods >$100. <br />- Pooling necessary<br />- Time to answer >24h. | - COG <<$10<br />- single sample analysis<br />- <1h to answer. | Low-cost mass-produced nanopore and/or single-molecule optical sequencers. |
