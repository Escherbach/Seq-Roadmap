# A roadmap towards ubiquitous metagenomic sequencing

Metagenomic sequencing (MGS) has the potential to [transform clinical diagnosis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0113-7) of infectious disease and [our ability to detect emerging pandemics](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/how-to-snuff-out-the-next-pandemic/).

In this roadmap, we backward from the vision of ubiquitous metagenomic sequencing at the point-of-care as a means of compressing the time required to detect outbreaks of novel pathogens from weeks to months.![Image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xi-8aqvmLOw4d2EJBbllP57V8OkAmXe_pf4cigggnef8ONqR_lY2qxQY-f1sJkBM-KLgsd2MRp0OBOovjcTH4Eyno6HKXzDGAsMmEDOO3LR7m811_chC06HlIgUQU_ntmLGhYTFvNmQXiCG864QhlA)

- As of early 2023, MGS is not used as a mainline diagnostic at the point of care. Clinical validation in terms of sensitivity, specificity and impact on treatment will be necessary to enable adoption at the clinic. We review the literature assessing the use of MGS on clinical samples and conclude that **[sensitivity](https://escherbach.github.io/seq-roadmap/sensitivity) can be comparable to that of qPCR** given sufficient sequencing depth.
- In the context of infectious disease testing, **time to answer**, **[simplicity of sample preparation](https://escherbach.github.io/seq-roadmap/sample-prep)** and **cost** are essential. Sequencing technology has largely been optimized for a different set of criteria. In particular, the most widespread approach of Illumina-style sequencing by synthesis is unlikely to provide sufficient sequencing depth if we are aiming for a sample-to-answer time of ~1 hour.
- We see two candidate technologies that could provide sufficient sequencing depth in this timeframe at a cost comparable with qPCR. These are biological nanopores and single-molecule optical sequencing. See discussion of [platforms](https://escherbach.github.io/seq-roadmap/platforms).
