# A roadmap towards ubiquitous metagenomic sequencing

Metagenomic sequencing has the potential to [transform clinical diagnosis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0113-7) of infectious disease and [our ability to detect emerging pandemics](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/how-to-snuff-out-the-next-pandemic/).

- For human respiratory samples, **[sensitivity](https://escherbach.github.io/seq-roadmap/sensitivity) can be comparable to that of qPCR** given sufficient sequencing depth.
